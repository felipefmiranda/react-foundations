# React progress

This documentation is my follow-through some tutorials, which I'll be incrementing as I keep going. For the tutorial, see [Next.js Course](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations/)

I'm currently working on a web application, but I got stuck by not having the foundations of React and Javascript. So I decided to take a step back and do some basic courses before going on.

So far, nothing here is my creation, but I'll keep updating this README and repo as I go. My objective is to merge this repo with the project's [original repo](https://github.com/Riskbreaker-Labs/the-white-rabbit), using the same stack that is there.

After the first course, I intend to do this [dashboard-app course](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app), which is very similar to the real application I need to do.

## How to use this repo:

I really recommend you to go into the course yourself and do your own repo, but if you want to look further into this, after cloning the repo, run:

```
npm install react@latest react-dom@latest next@latest
```
